Bannoffe Pie

Ingredients: 

For the base:
100g butter, melted
250g digestive biscuits, crushed

For the caramel:
100g butter
100g dark brown soft sugar
397g can Carnation Condensed Milk

For the top:
4 small bananas
300ml carton whipping cream
lightly whipped grated chocolate

Method:


1. Put the biscuit crumbs in your bowl, then tip in the melted butter and mix it all together. Spoon this into the base and press against the bottom and sides – this is the base of the banoffee pie recipe. Chill it for ten minutes.

2. Melt the butter and sugar into a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring all the time until the sugar has dissolved. Add the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil for about a minute, stirring all the time for a thick golden caramel. Spread the caramel over the base, cool and then chill for about 1 hour, until firm or until ready to serve.

3. Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate. Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly whipped cream and spoon over the base. Decorate with the remaining bananas and finish with the grated chocolate.
